## 3-14： frond end group tasks:
vijay: sign in page
zhengren: sign up page
jianing: core functionality

## 3-21: task reassignment:
vijay: pages & style design
zhengren: side functionalities & interaction
jianing: core functionality

Problem report:

# 1
We found that the interaction of frond-end and back-end is harder than we expected
Since it can be done in different approches, 
achieving it requires understanding of both the front-end and back-end codes
and sometimes it can be confused that kiran's and my work is having repetition and conflict.
Therefore we need one person to handle interaction specifically.

# 2
It is inefficient for us to develop signup and signin functionalities separately.
Thereforeafter discussion, 
we reassigned our tasks and now everyone is doing what he is good at now.
