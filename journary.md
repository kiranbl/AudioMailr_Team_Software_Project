## 3-14ï¼š frond end group tasks:

## 3-21: task reassignment:
vijay: pages & style design
zhengren: side functionalities & interaction
jianing: core functionality

Problem report:

# 1
We found that the interaction of frond-end and back-end is harder than we expected
Since it can be done in different approches, 
achieving it requires understanding of both the front-end and back-end codes
and sometimes it can be confused that kiran's and my work is having repetition and conflict.
Therefore we need one person to handle interaction specifically.

# 2
It is inefficient for us to develop signup and signin functionalities separately.
Thereforeafter discussion, 
we reassigned our tasks and now everyone is doing what he is good at now.

## Update 3/22:

task reassignment, see details in journary

components building for side functionalities on progress.

## Update 3/27:

frond-end & back-end connection completed.

signup & signin function completed.

## Update on 4/23/2023:
intial mailbox app
not finished yet. I only upload this to back for backup.
issues needed fixing:
# 1
For our convenience, I applied two .css files for each .js files in components folder.
By this mean, vijay's intial .css files are with the .js file stay in compontents folder.
But you can also adjust the style by editing the .css files in css folder.
I used two import approaches so there will be no conflicts if you check the classnames carefully.
Feel free to change the classnames so the intial .css files can be actived.

# 2
I moved all the components files to components folder that i created.
I created containers folder for container files of every components files.
By this mean, data-fetching and rendering are detached. Life is much easier.

# 3 
For now we just focus on meeting 8 of the 0 features on the list.
I have written some codes for the side functions that we may or may not want to make do.
Do not worry about them if you are confused.

# 4
The unread function is necessary. We must figure out that. Cause it says in the features list that the application shall allow the user to select what if all unread emails in the inbox should be read.

# 5
we need to create a button for user to indicate what emails they need to be read to them.
This is tricky. I still have no idea how to do it. Also in the features list.

# 6
After merging the log in system and mailbox, the navbar of the log in and sign up page became so long.
It could be some style conflict.

4/24 update

# mock json server for testing

//installation
npm install -g json-server

//runs it
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001

## Update 5-5:

After complete mergeing with back-end, now the most tricky part of this project is cleared

Now frond-end and back-end are well connected, the gamil part is nearly done

From now on, my branch will be including both front-end and server-end

I have included the a doc called "table" on the root, which contains the database set up

If you have any doubts about this instruction file, speak to kiran, he made it

The back end code is slightly different from the one on kiran's or leyan's

I have commented most of the changes

Below I will demonstrate the brief work flow of the project

## Routes of entry:

# User can log in and play with the mock mailbox app without any provider account

User can go to sign up link and register an local account which is stored in local database
By successfully logging in, user is dericted to the mailbox url
The sample mailbox app does not support Compose function

# The main entrance is the googleIcon button and OutLookIcon button.

click gmail button 
=>>> body {authtype:"google"} 
// auth request sent to gmail
===>>>  /signin or signup api
// get access
 ===>>>> {url:"dasdsahjkhdbksad/xciasics"} 
// generate url for user's gmail account to get access of our app
==>>> open it in a new tab for user 
// user directed to the url and gets permition to our app
====>> usertoken generated after login 
// token generated, server side pass token to client side with an encryption method
=>>> redirect the user to the dashboard after sending get request to /receivemail api
// client side decrypt token in the cookie, use this token to apply api calls to gmail
=>>> resposne ===> [{},{}]
// for instance, frond end make api call to server, server end point make request to gmail and pull inbox to our app
// the front-end will re-structure the response data, transform the data into Redux store for client side functionalities

This flow is from my perspective, if one wants to know more, speak to back-end team

# featurelist of this project (we need to do 8 out of 9)

1. The application shall act as an email client, where a user is allowed to send or receive emails.
status: receive checked, now doing send, hopefully finish it on 5/6 or 5/7
approach of receive: for receive, as mentioned before, if user logs in the app with google or outlook account,
this app automatically pulls all the "unread" emails from their inbox with an api get request;
for send, app applies a post request
approach of send: user should be able to send emails with the app, and the sent email should be visiable in the 
sent box.

2. The application shall make use of IMAP and SMTP protocols to achieve requirement 1 above
status: check
approach: unknown

3. The application shall allow a user to login using their email and password.
status: check
approach: we have a local data for this. Front-end pass the form of user information to server, then server handles
the check, storage, then generate a token, pass it back to fron-end

4. The application shall allow a user to indicate what emails they need to be read to them
status: check
approach: User can do that by opening one mail and then clicking "read" button

5. The user shall have the ability to select the preferred voice from a list of 2-3.
status: check
approach: User can do that by opening one mail and then adjust the voice perferences on "Settings" button

6. The application shall allow the user to select what if all unread emails in the Inbox should be read
status: check
approach: User can do that by opening one mail and then clicking "read all unread emails" button

7. The application shall allow a user to select specific times when emails should be read. E.g. Read all unread
emails to me by 5pm
status: ???
Jianing please confirm on this one really soon

8. The application shall be able to work with multiple email addresses. E.g. - Work email and personal email.
status: doing now
approach: the app is supposed to allow user to pull emails from different accounts, which means, e.g. one 
can read gmail and outlook at same time in one app. this part is on progress
I plan to make it do on the user profile dropbox button on top right
after I finish feature 1, I will look into this one

9. The application shall be able to work with any email provider that supports IMAP and SMTP.
status: we instantly give up on this one, which is more of a joke than feature

# send mail 
click compse mail
===>>

{
    "toAddress":"any mail",
    "subject":"",
    "text":""
}
===>>> send post request to /sendmail
====>> response -> {
    "errorcode": 6000,
    "message": "Mail has been sent to kiran.pro13@gmail.com successfully.."
}

3. The application shall allow a user to login using their email and password.
status: check
approach: after discussion, we decided to remove the sign up and log in system we made from our main entrance, since
it does not really help our app meet the requirements
however we kept it as a prototype as part of our work

added:

by this mean, user now has full control of email list
